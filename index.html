             <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
             <p>So my website is finally here, or at least in part! This site is a work in progress, but in the meantime I wanted to tell you a bit about myself as well as about my work!</p>
             <p>I am an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California since 2013. My focus has generally been in the information technology sector with key expertise in both domestic and global law, corporate and commercial law, intellectual property law, technology, and privacy and data security law. </p>
             <p>The more experience I gained as an attorney in the information technology sector, the more important I realized it was to develop more than just a basic understanding of software engineering. So, I decided to take the first uncomfortable steps towards my road less traveled and take an intensive coding course.</p>
             <p>This website and my portfolio are a testament to all that I learned in my journey to learn basic computer coding as well as my blood, sweat, and tears (but I didn't create a separate portfolio for that!).</p>
             <p>xx Tamar Cabayan</p>
